# Hobo MVC

Hobo MVC is aiming to be super simple and super intuitive MVC framework. It is inspired by 2 my personally favorite MVC frameworks, F3(fat free) framework and PHP-MVC framework, but
Hobo do not have that many features as both of them. Hobo core is currently built on 3 libs, and they are `router.php`,
`session.php` and `view.php`. Names of these libs are self-explaining.

## Installation

### Using GitHub

First, copy this repo into a public accessible folder on your server (or to public_html folder of your FTP if you are using shared hosting).
Common techniques are a) downloading and extracting the .zip / .tgz by hand, b) cloning the repo with git (into var/www if you are on Linux or wamp/www if you are on Windows and have Wamp installed)

```
git clone https://github.com/deathbeam/hobomvc.git /your/public/web/folder
```

### Getting the repo via Composer

```
composer create-project deathbeam/hobomvc /your/public/web/folder dev-master
```

### Configure .htaccess
1. mod_rewrite is required for Hobo routing. Most of web hosts have it already installed, but if you are hosting Hobo by self, you need to install it.

2. Change the .htaccess file from
```
RewriteBase /hobomvc/
```
to where you put this project, relative to the web root folder. So when you put this project into
the web root, like directly in /var/www or /wamp/www, then the line should look like or can be commented out:
```
RewriteBase /
```
If you have put the project into a sub-folder, then put the name of the sub-folder here:
```
RewriteBase /sub-folder/
```

## A quickstart tutorial

To quickly create your first hello world application in Hobo, here is step by step tutorial.

Include Hobo base at start of your index.php file, right after `<?php` PHP opening tag.
```php
$hobo = require("application/base.php");
```
Now we will create 2 functions what will echo simple hello world messages when called.
```php
function index() {
	echo "Hello world.";
}
function error() {
	echo "404! This is not the web page you are looking for.;
}
```
And now it is time to link these 2 functions to their URL routes. We will set error function to be default route
because default route is called when we will type relative URL what is not defined in routing table.
```php
$hobo->route("GET /", "index");
$hobo->default_route("error");
```
And last line in file should always be this command what will execute Hobo router, so we will add it after all above code.
```php
$hobo->run();
```

## Configuration
Hobo can be configured in 2 ways. First one is defining globals and second one is loading them from config file.

### Defining globals
This is basic configuration using `$hobo=>set` function. Add these functions right after `$hobo = require("application/base.php");`
#### Configuration for: Project URL
Put URL to your project folder here, for local development "127.0.0.1" or "localhost" (plus sub-folder) is fine
```php
$hobo->set('URL', 'http://127.0.0.1/hobomvc/');
```
#### Configuration for: Database
This is the place where you define your database credentials, database type etc. If you do not want to use database, simply do not add these
configuration setting for database.
```php
$hobo->set('DB_TYPE','mysql');
$hobo->set('DB_HOST','127.0.0.1');
$hobo->set('DB_NAME','hobomvc');
$hobo->set('DB_USER','root');
$hobo->set('DB_PASS','mysql');
```

### Loading configuration file
Loading configuration file is as easy as drinking beer.
```php
$hobo->config('config.ini');
```
And config.ini basic configuration contents are below. If you do not want to use database, simply do not add
configuration settings for database.
```INI
[globals]
URL=http://127.0.0.1/hobomvc/
SESSION_NAME=hobomvc
COOKIE_PATH=/
COOKIE_EXPIRY=31536000
DB_TYPE=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_NAME=hobomvc
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=mysql
```
