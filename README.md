fw.php is aiming to be blazing fast and simple PHP micro framework. It is inspired by my personally favorite framework, F3(fat free), but
fw.php have only features what are barebone for framework. fw do not have caching, but it do not really needs it 
becouse fw is blazing fast with minimal overhead (fw.php have less than 10KB), its templating system uses only PHP
and is built on single PHP file which contains only 12 functions.

## Installation

* copy this repo into a public accessible folder on your server (or to public_html folder of your FTP if you are using shared hosting).

Common techniques are a) downloading and extracting the .zip / .tgz by hand, b) cloning the repo with git (into var/www if you are on Linux or wamp/www if you are on Windows and have Wamp installed)
```
git clone https://github.com/deathbeam/fwphp.git /your/public/web/folder
```
or c) getting the repo via Composer
```
composer create-project deathbeam/fwphp /your/public/web/folder dev-master
```
* Now, we need to install `mod_rewrite` becouse it is required for `.htaccess`.

## Configuration
fw.php can be configured in 2 ways. First one is defining globals and second one is loading them from config file.
In examples below, we will:
* Load `cookie.php` extension from `plugins` folder
* Change directory of public files from default `public` to `new_public_dir`
* Set `/` route to `index` function

### Defining globals
This is basic configuration from index.php. 
```php
$fw->set('public_dir', 'new_public_dir');
$fw->cookie = 'cookie.php';
$fw->route('GET /', 'index');
```

### Loading configuration file
Loading configuration file is as easy as drinking beer.
```php
$fw->config('config.json');
```
And some basic configuration example is below:
```JSON
{
	"globals": {
		"public_dir": "new_public_dir"
	},
	"libs": {
		"cookie": "cookie.php"
	},
	"routes": {
		"GET /": "index",
	}
}
```

## Views and Templates
fw.php have super simple templating system using PHP as templating language.
Drawing template is simple:
```php
$fw->draw('test.php');
```
Templates can read global variables set by `$fw->set` method.

### Example template
Below, we will create simple template logic.
Code what will go into routed function in `index.php`
```php
$fw
	->set('header','This is example header')
	->set('body','Content goes here')
	->set('footer','This is example footer'))
	->draw('default.php');
```
We will save code below as `default.php` to `/public` directory
```php
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>The Default Template</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
			<h1>You are viewing the default page!</h1>
			<?php echo $header;?>
		</header>
		<section>
			<?php echo $body;?>
		</section>
		<footer>
			<?php echo $footer;?>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```
## Routes
In fw.php I implemented routing very similar to F3 routing. Features:
* Dynamic routing with named parameters
* Reversed routing
* Flexible regular expression routing
* ReST route mapping

### Example routing
```php
// mapping routes
$fw->route('home: GET|POST /', 'home');
$fw->route('GET /users', 'users');
$fw->route('users_show: GET /users/@id', 'showUser');
$fw->route('users_do: POST /users/@id/@action', 'userController->@action');

// provide ReST interface by mapping HTTP requests to class method
$fw->route('/rest', 'some_class');

// default route (404 page)
$fw->route('default', 'error');

// redirect
$fw->reroute('users_show', array('id' => 5));
$fw->reroute('/users');
```
