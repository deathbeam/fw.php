# Hobo MVC
Hobo MVC is aiming to be super simple and super intuitive MVC framework. It is inspired by my personally favorite MVC framework, F3(fat free), but
Hobo have only features what are barebone for MVC framework. Hobo core is currently built on 2 libs, and they are `router.php`,
and `base.php`. Names of these libs are self-explaining. It is easily extensible (for example check `/libs` folder).

## Installation

* copy this repo into a public accessible folder on your server (or to public_html folder of your FTP if you are using shared hosting).

Common techniques are a) downloading and extracting the .zip / .tgz by hand, b) cloning the repo with git (into var/www if you are on Linux or wamp/www if you are on Windows and have Wamp installed)
```
git clone https://github.com/deathbeam/hobomvc.git /your/public/web/folder
```
or c) getting the repo via Composer
```
composer create-project deathbeam/hobomvc /your/public/web/folder dev-master
```
* Now, we need to install `mod_rewrite` becouse it is required for `.htaccess` (what is heart of all MCV frameworks).
* Now, run SQL file named `hobomvc.sql` 

## A quickstart tutorial

To quickly create your first hello world application in Hobo, here is minimalistic index.php example.
```php
$hobo = require('application/base.php');
$hobo->route('GET /',
    function() {
        echo 'Hello, world!';
    }
);
$hobo->run();
```

## Configuration
Hobo can be configured in 2 ways. First one is defining globals and second one is loading them from config file.
In examples below, we will:
* Load cookie class from `libs/` folder
* Change directory of public files from default `public/` to `new_public_dir/`
* Set `/` route to `index` function

### Defining globals
This is basic configuration from index.php. 
```php
$hobo->cookie = 'cookie.php';
$hobo->set('PUBLIC_DIR', 'new_public_dir/')->apply();
$hobo->route('GET /', 'index');
```

### Loading configuration file
Loading configuration file is as easy as drinking beer.
```php
$hobo->config('config.json')->apply();
```
And some basic configuration example is below:
```JSON
{
	"globals": {
		"PUBLIC_DIR": "new_public_dir/"
	},
	"libs": {
		"cookie": "cookie.php"
	},
	"routes": {
		"GET /": "index",
	}
}
```

## Views and Templates
Hobo have super simple templating system using PHP as templating language.
Drawing template is simple:
```php
$hobo->draw('test.php');
```
Templates can read global variables set by `$hobo->set` method.

### Example template
Below, we will create simple template logic.
Code what will go into routed function in index.php
```php
$hobo
	->set('header','This is example header')
	->set('body','Content goes here')
	->set('footer','This is example footer'))
	->draw('default.php');
```
default.php template file in /public folder
```php
<!doctype html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>The Default Template</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
			<h1>You are viewing the default page!</h1>
			<?php echo $header;?>
		</header>
		<section>
			<?php echo $body;?>
		</section>
		<footer>
			<?php echo $footer;?>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```
## Routes
In Hobo we implemented very powerfull PHP router [AltoRouter](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter). Features
* Dynamic routing with named parameters
* Reversed routing
* Flexible regular expression routing
* Custom regexes

### Example routing
```php
// mapping routes
$hobo->route('GET|POST @home /', 'home#index');
$hobo->route('GET /users', array('c' => 'UserController', 'a' => 'ListAction'));
$hobo->route('GET @users_show /users/[i:id]', 'users#show');
$hobo->route('POST @users_do /users/[i:id]/[delete|update:action]', 'usersController#doAction');

// default route (404 page)
$hobo->route('default', 'error');

// reversed routing
$url = $hobo->generate('users_show', array('id' => 5));
```
You can use the following limits on your named parameters. AltoRouter will create the correct regexes for you.
```
*                    // Match all request URIs
[i]                  // Match an integer
[i:id]               // Match an integer as 'id'
[a:action]           // Match alphanumeric characters as 'action'
[h:key]              // Match hexadecimal characters as 'key'
[:action]            // Match anything up to the next / or end of the URI as 'action'
[create|edit:action] // Match either 'create' or 'edit' as 'action'
[*]                  // Catch all (lazy, stops at the next trailing slash)
[*:trailing]         // Catch all as 'trailing' (lazy)
[**:trailing]        // Catch all (possessive - will match the rest of the URI)
.[:format]?          // Match an optional parameter 'format' - a / or . before the block is also optional
```
Some more complicated examples
```
@/(?[A-Za-z]{2}_[A-Za-z]{2})$ // custom regex, matches language codes like "en_us" etc.
/posts/[*:title][i:id]        // Matches "/posts/this-is-a-title-123"
/output.[xml|json:format]?    // Matches "/output", "output.xml", "output.json"
/[:controller]?/[:action]?    // Matches the typical /controller/action 
```
The character before the colon (the 'match type') is a shortcut for one of the following regular expressions
```php
'i'  => '[0-9]++'
'a'  => '[0-9A-Za-z]++'
'h'  => '[0-9A-Fa-f]++'
'*'  => '.+?'
'**' => '.++'
''   => '[^/\.]++'
```
